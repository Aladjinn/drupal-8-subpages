<h1>Usability</h1>

<h2>Better authoring experience</h2>
<p>Creating content doesn’t have to be a chore. Work quickly and easily from wherever you’d like. All of Drupal 8’s built-in themes are responsive, so you can use all of the admin areas from your phone. The authoring interface is split into two regions—one for the heart of your content, and one for its settings. Focus on all of the details at once, or only the ones you need. And with the help of a CKEditor feature built specifically for Drupal, you can more easily control details like image alignment and captions right from the palm of your hand.</p>

<h2>With powerful customizations</h2>
<p>Manage authoring with WYSIWYG features designed to keep content creation neat and ordered. By default, the editor enforces clean markup and has formatting tools disabled. When you need to change settings, use a drag-and-drop configuration UI for adding and removing editor buttons.</p>
<p>Turn guidelines into structures with new fields for content modeling. Email, link, phone, entity reference, and date fields: they’re all included by default now. Reuse blocks in multiple regions, and create custom block types with their own unique settings. You can also configure blocks for important components that used to be hard-coded, like breadcrumbs and site names.</p>

<h2>Because there’s more in core</h2>
<p>Create listings of related content—like users, events, and news articles—without a contributed module; Views is now in core. You can even customize admin listings, because they’re built with Views too. But Views isn’t the only thing that’s new. Set different responsive styles for individual images. Also, custom blocks are fieldable, translatable, and revisionable. Maintain a default revision, and keep it published, while other drafts are created and deleted.</p>

<h2>And a commitment to accessibility</h2>
<p>Mark content regions with attributes that make them familiar, thanks to WAI-ARIA techniques and HTML5 semantic markup. Improve navigation by identifying menus, banners, and ancillary content areas, and letting keyboard users move through them more easily. You can even take advantage of these practices for administering your own sites. Drupal 8 puts these methods to work in a new admin toolbar that adapts to different screen widths, and is easier for people with screen readers to use.</p>
